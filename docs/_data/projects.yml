  summary: Fire spread prediction application leveraging an ML model
  description: |-
    Responsibilities:
    - Machine learning model configuration and training
    - Data pipeline
    - Database design
    - Google Maps Platform API configuration

    This project involves the retrieval of geospatial data, current weather metrics, and satellite-derived imagery to predict wildfire spread using a machine learning model.

    During the planning phase of the project, I took it upon myself to break down the project into components that could be assigned to my group members. As such, I was assigned the role of Project Manager and coordinated development efforts to meet deadlines and ensure progress.

    I took responsibility of the data pipeline, as well as the configuration and training of the machine learning model. Additionally, I created the foundational code for the fire spread preview using the Google Maps Platform API.

    The data pipeline involves retrieval of data from three APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Google Earth Engine Python API, FIRMS), transformation of that data using various Python libraries including, but not limited to, SciPy, NumPy, and pandas such that it is clean and of the correct shape to be fed into the model.

    The model is described to have a U-Net like convolutional neural net achitecture. As such, the prediction task is framed as an image segmentation problem where areas are classified as containing or not containing a fire. The model expects data of the shape ..., and the data pipeline cleaned and transformed the data to be of this shape.

    What I learned from this project was data transformations using Python, configuration and training of machine learning models.

    What I wished I did differently was spend less time trying to get everything perfect the first time around. It would have been better to develop a prototype and build incrementally from that, implementing necessary changes as they are identified.

    The idea of this project spawned from my hobby of 3D printing! This is a mock website where users can import a model file, preview it, and customize their order by changing some parameters relevant to 3D printed objects.

    The ThreeJS JavaScript library is used to enable the model preview, MongoDB enables the storage of printers and material available, and Express and Node make up the backend.
